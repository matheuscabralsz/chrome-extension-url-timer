## Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions:

*   `activeTab`: To get the URL of the current tab.
*   `scripting`: To execute the redirection script.
*   `storage`: To store the list of URLs and other settings.
*   `tabs`: To manage the tabs and redirect to the next URL.

## Disclaimer

This extension uses broad host permissions (`"http://*/*"` and `"https://*/*"`) to allow redirection to any website. This is a potential security risk. If you are concerned about the security of your data, you can disable the extension when you are not using it.
